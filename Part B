//** ENGR-2350 Template Project 
//** NAME: Xio Pelaez Cuacua & Gizelle Ojeda-Ericksen
//** RIN: 662068537 & 662065015
//** This is the base project for several activities and labs throughout
//** the course.  The outline provided below isn't necessarily *required*
//** by a C program; however, this format is required within ENGR-2350
//** to ease debugging/grading by the staff.
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// We'll always add this include statement. This basically takes the
// code contained within the "engr_2350_msp432.h" file and adds it here.
#include "engr2350_msp432.h"

// Add function prototypes here as needed.


// Add global variables here as needed.


int main( void ) {    /** Main Function ****/
  
    // Add local variables here as needed.

    // We always call the SysInit function first to set up the 
    // microcontroller for how we are going to use it.
    SysInit();

    // Place initialization code (or run-once) code here

    while( 1 ) {  
        // Place code that runs continuously in here

    }   
}    /** End Main Function ****/   

// Add function declarations here as needed

// Add interrupt functions last so they are easy to find
